# FEND Project 7 - Neighborhood Map

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview
This project was developed for the Udacity Front End Nano-Degree program. This neighborhood map project uses React along with some APIs and other external dependencies and tools including:

* Google Maps API
* FourSquare API
* React
* react-google-maps 
* Create React App

## Features
A list of traditional Irish pubs in the Pawtucket, Rhode Island area has been created. These locations display as markers on the map. Clicking a marker displays an info box containing the name of the venue, a description of the venue (if available), the venue's category, and the venue's address from FourSquare. Clicking the toggle sidebar button on the left of the screen opens and closes a sidebar menu with a list of the venues and a filter text box at the top. Typing into the text box filters the list of restaurants accordingly. Clicking a restaurant in the list activates the marker on the map as if it had been clicked which causes an infowindow to display venue details. 

## Required Packages

* react-google-maps
